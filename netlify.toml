# -----------------------------
# NETLIFY BUILD CONFIGURATION
# -----------------------------

[build]
  # The command Netlify runs to build your site.
  # This is executed in the Netlify CI environment on every deploy.
  #
  # In this case:
  # - npm installs dependencies
  # - then runs the "build" script from package.json
  #
  # Example from package.json:
  # "scripts": {
  #   "build": "vite build"
  # }
  #
  # Netlify expects this command to produce static files
  # that can be served to users.
  command = "npm run build"

  # The directory that Netlify will deploy to production.
  #
  # After the build command finishes, Netlify looks here
  # for the final output files (HTML, JS, CSS, assets).
  #
  # Common values:
  # - "dist" (Vite, Astro, Vue, React w/ Vite)
  # - "build" (Create React App)
  # - "public" (custom setups)
  #
  # IMPORTANT:
  # If this folder name does not match your build output,
  # your site will deploy but appear blank or 404.
  publish = "dist"

# -------------------------------------
# BUILD ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
# -------------------------------------

[build.environment]
  # Netlify automatically scans environment variables
  # during builds to detect exposed secrets (API keys, tokens).
  #
  # Vite exposes client-side environment variables that start
  # with VITE_ to the browser by design.
  #
  # This line tells Netlify:
  # "Do NOT fail the build if you see this key."
  #
  # Use this ONLY for keys that are:
  # - Intended to be public
  # - Restricted by domain, referrer, or usage limits
  #
  # In this case:
  # VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY is expected to be used in frontend JS,
  # so Netlify's secret scanner is intentionally bypassed.
  #
  # ⚠️ WARNING:
  # Never omit scanning for private server-side keys.
  SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS = "VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY"
