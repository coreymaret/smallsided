# Fixed Unified Registration System

This system uses YOUR EXACT original styling and functionality.
The ONLY change is consolidating duplicate code.

## What Was Changed
- 4 separate components → 1 unified component
- Duplicate validation/formatting code → shared utilities
- 4 separate SCSS files → 1 shared SCSS file

## What Was NOT Changed
- All your original UI layouts
- All your original step flows
- All your original styling
- All your original conditional logic
- All your original animations

## Installation
1. Replace `src/components/Register/` with this folder
2. Test all 4 pages - they should look/work EXACTLY the same
3. Delete old components once verified
